Neural Network used MLP. its for univerisity purposes, I myself have no idea how it work, but in any case its for urgent stuffs

* **got two files**, **MLP**, **MLP2**
  
* **MLP** use directly tenserflow, and show accurency stright forward, and use  two different dataset with same structures (iris.train, iris.test)
* **MLP2** use Sklearn package, use only one dataset (Iris_data.csv) and shows some graphs and confusing matrix, and accurency
